## üì¶ Installation

1. Install the following packages:

```sh
npm install --save-dev cypress-plugin-filter-runnables
```

2. In `cypress/support/e2e.js` (For E2E tests) and/or `cypress/support/component.js` (For Component tests),

```js
import 'cypress-plugin-filter-runnables';
```

---

## üîç Open mode

Run `npx cypress open` to launch Cypress in `open` mode.

Choose a spec file to run and you will be able to filter by suite/test title at the top of the reporter.

You can combine multiple searches by separating them with a semicolon (`;`).

Example:

`@smoke; can add todo`

### Pairing with `cypress-plugin-grep-boxes`

The [cypress-plugin-grep-boxes](https://github.com/dennisbergevin/cypress-plugin-grep-boxes) is a great companion for this plugin.

Paired with `cypress-plugin-grep-boxes` (`@bahmutov/cy-grep` is also required), you can filter suites/tests and use the checkboxes to run only selected tests:

Additionally, you can filter tags when paired with `cypress-plugin-grep-boxes` (version `2.1.0` of `@bahmutov/cy-grep` required):

In addition, `cypress-plugin-grep-boxes` supports a [disableInitialAutoRun feature](https://github.com/dennisbergevin/cypress-plugin-grep-boxes/blob/main/README.md#disableinitialautorun) that will prevent Cypress Test Runner from automatically running available tests once a spec file is open.

This gives you a moment to filter down to whichever tests to select before running them:
